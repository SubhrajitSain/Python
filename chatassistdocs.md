## Problems
**404**: If you see a "404" error on the website or web app, it means the server hosting ChatAssist is offline. The server is just a laptop running a script, so it's often offline. Sorry for any problems this causes. Refresh the page to check if the server gets back online.

**Password**: If you are prompted for a password, please kindly copy and  use this ip address as the password: ```103.188.163.154```

**TypeError**: If you get a "TypeError" message or any message separated by a horizontal bar, it is a fault which is produced due to internal server error, which is very temporary. Just enter another prompt or the same prompt and the error message will be erased automatically.

**502**: If you see this error, please refresh the page. This is an error that occurs when the files of the web app is being modified by the developer.

**Bad styling**: If the styling of the web app does not appear (colourful text, background image, etc) then just refresh the page. This occurs when the CSS for the web app is being modified.
